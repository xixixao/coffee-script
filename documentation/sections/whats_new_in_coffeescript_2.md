### Whatâ€™s New In CoffeeScript(Flow)?

CoffeeScript(Flow), just like CoffeeScript 2, compiles to modern JavaScript syntax. Unlike CoffeeScript 2, it has full support for Flow type checking, and it has further stripped the CoffeeScript syntax to avoid "multiple equivalent ways" of expressing the same program. CoffeeScript(Flow) also aims to be fully pretty-printable via [prettier](github.com/facebook/prettier).

There are many [breaking changes from CoffeeScript 2.x to (Flow)](#breaking-changes); but the upgrade process should be smooth for most projects.
